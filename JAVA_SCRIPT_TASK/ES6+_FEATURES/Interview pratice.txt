 Final Interview Practice Tasks
Convert an ES5 program into ES6.

Identify ES6 features used in a given code snippet.

Explain why ES6 is more suitable for React.

Answer: “Do we need to learn every ES version?”


1️⃣ Convert an ES5 program into ES6

ES5 Example:

var sum = function(a, b){
    return a + b;
};
console.log(sum(2, 3));


ES6 Version:

const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(2, 3));


✅ Key ES6 features used:

const instead of var (block-scoped variable)

Arrow function (a, b) => a + b

2️⃣ Identify ES6 features in a code snippet

Example Code:

const user = { name: "Abishek" };
const greeting = `Hello ${user.name}`;


ES6 Features Used:

const (block-scoped variable)

Template literals (`Hello ${user.name}`)

3️⃣ Why ES6 is more suitable for React

Arrow functions → cleaner syntax for functional components.

let/const → prevent scope-related bugs.

Modules (import/export) → organize React components.

Template literals → easy dynamic JSX content.

Destructuring → cleaner props and state handling.

4️⃣ “Do we need to learn every ES version?”

Answer:
No, you don’t need to learn every ES version. Focus on ES6+ features, because modern frameworks (React, Node.js) rely on them. Older ES versions (ES3, ES5) are mostly for legacy code.
